# rdkit-chem gem

GEM for [RDKIT](http://rdkit.org/), an Open-Source Cheminformatics Software

## Environment

### Prerequisites
  * cmake 3.8 or later
  * curl
  * tar, sed, make (those should be present anyway)
  * SWIG 2 or later
  * python header (`python-dev`)
  * sqlite (`sqlite3-dev`)

gem install openbabel

It downloads the sources, compiles and installs RDKIT with the ruby bindings.
The installation may last very long - please be patient.
